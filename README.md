# Dynamic NFT demo

This is a hardhat project with the contract written in Solidity, and compiled with the version 0.8.10;

What we do here is that we mint an SVG as an NFT on the mumbai testnet.
But we have a dynamic value in the nft. 

The valuse of 'Levels' attribute is dynamic.
Everytime the Train function is called, the value is incremented by one, and the metadata changes.
It's really cool actually, and makes for a fun little demonstration. 
Might seem lame on the repo, though.


Check out this verified contract.

These 3 NFTs were given different values **AFTER** minting.
